/*

n = 7; // Size of the pattern
This line defines the size of our pattern. We're using 7 as it matches the 7x7 grid in your example.

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
This is our outer loop. It iterates through each row of the pattern, from 0 to 6 (7 rows total).

for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
This is our inner loop. For each row, it iterates through each column, from 0 to 6 (7 columns total).

int value;
We declare a variable to hold the value we'll print for each position.

if (i <= 3 && j <= 3)
    value = 4 - Math.Min(i, j);
This handles the upper-left quadrant of the pattern. If both i and j are 3 or less, we're in this quadrant.
The value is calculated by subtracting the smaller of i or j from 4.

else if (i <= 3)
    value = 4 - Math.Min(i, 6 - j);
This handles the upper-right quadrant. If i is 3 or less but j is greater than 3,
we're here. We use 6 - j to "mirror" the j value.

else if (j <= 3)
    value = 4 - Math.Min(6 - i, j);
This handles the lower-left quadrant. If i is greater than 3 but j is 3 or less, 
we're here. We use 6 - i to "mirror" the i value.

else
    value = 4 - Math.Min(6 - i, 6 - j);
This handles the lower-right quadrant. If both i and j are greater than 3, we're here. We mirror both i and j.

Console.Write(value);
This prints the calculated value without moving to a new line.

Console.WriteLine();
After each row is complete, this moves to a new line for the next row.

The key to this pattern is understanding that it's symmetrical in four quadrants,
with the center being at (3,3). The value at each position is determined by its distance
from the nearest edge of the pattern, which is why we use 4 minus the minimum distance to either edge.
