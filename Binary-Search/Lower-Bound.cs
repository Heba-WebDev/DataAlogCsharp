/*
Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the
lower bound of x. The lower bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest
index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal
to a given key i.e. x.

If no such index is found, return the size of the array.
