union[^1] retrieves the last element of the union list.
The condition checks if:
The union list is empty (union.Count == 0) â€” no elements added yet.
The last added element (union[^1]) is not equal to the current value being processed (arr1[pointer1] or arr2[pointer2]).
This ensures no duplicate values are added to the union list.
